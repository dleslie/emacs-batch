# Emacs Batch

Docker file to run emacs in batch mode.

IE, to convert this org file to html:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run --rm			  \
	--user $(id -u):$(id -g)  \
	--name emacs-batch	  \
	-v `pwd`:/src		  \
	dleslie/emacs-batch	  \
	/usr/bin/emacs --batch	  \
	--eval "(progn (use-package htmlize) (with-temp-buffer (find-file \"readme.org\") (org-html-export-to-html)))"
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, a shell script has been provided:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./run.sh "(progn (use-package htmlize) (with-temp-buffer (find-file \"readme.org\") (org-html-export-to-html)))"
#+END_SRC

The environment contains the =straight.el= implementation of =use-package=, and the common set of elpa targets pre-configured to use =HTTPS=.

It is expected that the working directory is mounted to =/src/=.
